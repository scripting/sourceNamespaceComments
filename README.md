# Source Namespace Comments
A place to ask questions and comment on the <a href="http://source.scripting.com/">Source namespace</a>.

It was pointed out that there was no place to comment on the Source namespace, which I use to add features to my RSS feeds that are not in the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS 2.0 spec</a>. Anyone is welcome to use the namespace in their work. Interop is great. If we both use it, our feeds have some measure of compatibility.

### Where to post

Anyway, if you have a question or comment about the Source namespace, <a href="https://github.com/scripting/sourceNamespaceComments/issues">open an issue here</a>.
