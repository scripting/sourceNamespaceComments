# sourceNamespaceComments
A place to ask questions and comment on the Source namespace.

It was pointed out that there was no place to comment on the <a href="http://source.scripting.com/">Source namespace</a>, which I use to add features to my RSS feeds that are not in the RSS 2.0 spec. Anyone is welcome to use the namespace in their work. Interop is great. If we both use it, our feeds have some measure of compatibility.

Anyway, if you have a question or comment about the Source namespace, open an issue here.
